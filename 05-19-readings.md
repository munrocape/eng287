## Raw data is an oxymoron

##### Introduction

- data is increasing at a dizzying pace
- but if data is subject to us, we are subject to data
  - can extrapolate trends, identify terrorists, ...
- questions arise
  - is data about you yours?
  - can you even check out of the system?
  
- ultimately
  - data is cooked, never raw
  - saying its raw is an unnoticed assumption about it
  - this can lead to issues of faith/neutrality
  - also - consider the _interpretation_ of the data
    - that can be subject to who views it or what it is weighed against
    - how have these impacted events? perceptions?
    - we cannot separate data from history, vice versa
