# William Blake Archive

Full archieve can be found [here](http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/).

Here are Genius listings for the poems that are referenced explicitly (I found the screenshots of the original works to be low quality and of poor readability due to the low resolution, poor contrast, and typeface).

- [Songs of Innocence - Chimney Sweeper](http://genius.com/William-blake-the-chimney-sweeper-songs-of-innocence-annotated)
- [Songs of Experience - Chimney Sweeper](http://genius.com/William-blake-the-chimney-sweeper-songs-of-experience-annotated)

The rest of the `Songs of Innocence` and `Songs of Experience` collections can be browsed on both Genius and the Blake Archive.

# Print Is Flat, Code Is Deep: The Importance of Media-Specific Analysis

##### Abstract:

- After 500 years of print ...
  - analysis of it has died
  - `media specific` analysis needs to be ushered in and the medium in which they are instantiated matters
  - `materiality`: interplay between text's physical characteristics and signifying strategies
  - Texts are embodied entities that still maintain a central focus on interpretation
  - Materiality is emergent - cannot be specified in advance. It must take into account physical specificity

##### There are 9 specifics to electronic hypertext

1. Dynamic images
2. Both analogue resemblance and digital coding
3. Generated through fragmentation and recombination
4. Depth (operate in 3 dimensions) (also time, I would say)
5. Written in code as well as natural language
6. Mutable, transformable
7. Spaces to navigate
8. Written/read in distributed cognitive environments
9. Initiate and demand cyborg reading practices

- These 9 things are ignored in analysis - they shouldn't be
  - not only that, but they are taken for granted / print-based assumptions are made

- There were people predicting this shift
  - "Text is a metaphor for a network"
  - "Text is not a computable object" (computable: limited, bound)
  - ^ Anticipating what cannot be anticipated 
  - TEXT is ubiquitous, BOOK is media-specific
  - What is grounded though is text is defined as its relationship _differences_ to books
    - As opposed as through its relationship _with_ electronic textuality

- What does that even mean - medium-specific analysis
  - Don't just consider in isolation (actually, the contrary)
  - 'recursive dynamic immitating one another'
    - E-readers that allow you to dog mark pages, add realistic-looking paper clips, ...
    - Print is now copying digital - arrows to imitate hyperlinks, ...
  - not similarity and difference, but simulation and instantiation (move from text to screen/page)
  - (computer and book), (program and interface), (code and ink), (mutable image and inscribed mark), ...

- Hypertext/links
  - conceived in 1945 - was originally 'go to' commands
  - If we restrict, we lose this connection and ability to understand how mutations propogate
  - `MSA`: Media Specific Analysis
  - It is important to hold terms constant across forms to facilitate MSA
    - literary work is the 'style and sentiment' - this constitutes identity
      - must consider more than just print/paper
      - not just ideas, but how these ideas were expressed
      - defined literary author as a man 
      - defined his work as mixing intellectual labor with materials afforded him
      - but emphasised literay property as an intellectual construction (owed nothing to the medium)
      - print does not have a body - merely a speaking mind
    - physical / verbal split seriously impeded its recognition (MSA)
      - easy to think text on screen is the same as text on a page
      - why: computer is the most successful imitation machine on the planet
      - the reason WHY: it differs profoundly from paper (which cannot do this)
      - but not all aspects are equally important (dynamic interplay) (consider impact of screen versus power cord)
        - potentially infinite: polymers that make up plastic, ...
    - `MATERIALITY`: interplay between a text's physical characteristics and its signifying strategies
      - Composed of more than just the characters themselves but the relations they create

- Hypertext - what defines it (in terms of a rough heuristic)
  - Multiple reading paths
  - Some kind of linking mechanism
  - Chunked text (text that is discrete units and linked together)

- Examples of hypertext
  - Encyclopedia, books with different paths, ...
  - even folding pages to reveal info counts

- How to differentiate between electronic/print hypertext
  - What can you say about electronic hypertext as a medium?
    - What can be achieved in print/electronic?
  - Ultimately must consider the *medium* and the extent to which it can be simlated in print

##### Point 1: Electronic hypertexts are dynamic images

- No font - only pixels. Need to be refreshed thousands of times a second
  - The description of how it works almost made me barf
  - Can simulate things given we control/generate it 
  - There is a layer of code behind this that is not apparent to the user
    - `Print is flat, code is deep`

`"In the computer, the signifier exists not as a durably inscribed flat mark
but as a screenic image produced by layers of code precisely correlated
through correspondence rules, from the electronic polarities that correlate
with the bit stream to the bits that correlate with binary numbers,
to the numbers that correlate with higher-level statements, such as commands,
and so on."`

##### Point 2: Hypertexts include both analogue resemblance and digital coding

- At the core, a computer is electronic. mechanical.
  - Oreo cookie: analogue bottom (CPU), frothy digital middle, analog top (display) 
  - Digital in terms of discrete flow versus continuous flow of information
- We can employ algorithms/etc to print.
  - Restrict words to 3 characters, space between words is `n` where `n` is the current page number

##### Point 3: Hypertexts are generated through fragmentation and recombination

- fragmentation, recombination intrinsic to platform. (frothy middle)
  - book where you cut strips up and recombine for new poems
  - scenarios that were taken from scrabble games (letters fragmented, digital nature of alphabet)
  - fragmentation/recombo much deeper/intrinsic to digital stuff

##### Point 4: Hypertexts have depth and operate in three dimensions

`scripton`: surface image (HTML source, things user can see)

`texton`: underlying code

##### Point 5: Hypertexts are bilingual: written in code & language

things are done through making and doing
  - print is markup. font, layout, ...
  - digital needs the extra step of a specific parser to understand it

##### Point 6: Hypertexts are mutable, transformable

##### Point 7: Hypertexts are spaces to navigate
