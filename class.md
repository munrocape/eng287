### Criticisms of CYOA

- literature with a small "l" not a big L
	 - is this because childrens lit is looked down upon?


### Features of text adventures

- intricate spatial system
- genre with complicated paratextual apparatuses (not the text itself, but maps, advetisements, title pages, boxing, ...)

### Dreamhold

- dreamhold: memory palace
	- memory palace a construct to aid with memory, a memory technique
	- myth: greek poet invented it at a banquet that went wrong: building collapsed. couldnt identify bodies. had to recall all the names.

- amnesia: a classic trope.
	- to resolve the contradiction of the "knower" of the game as well as beginner knowing nothing of it.

- gives serious attention to beginners
	- beginner: get the masks
	- metalevel: narrator talking to the "real you"
	- author knowledgale of what cliches they are recycling


- endings
	- diagram
		- go back to prior life. you return fromt he memory palace w/ memory.
	- final mask
		- go back to where you were
	- doorstep of heaven
		- you join a godlike figure (or you become one) 
		- julio camillo: if you construct memory palace with all possible objects, you could have knowledge of entire cosmos
			- need cosmos big enough
			- navigate the dreamhold successfully enough

- discussion
	- is it a story
	- is it a game
	- is it literature

- scifi / text adventure is bad
	- they spend so much time on environment / space


#### Jenkins article

- transmedia storytelling environment
	- telling a single story across multiple platforms / formats
		- douglas copeland's jPod (book -> tv series -> internet extensions like active blogs)

- environment storytelling
	- disneyworld, pirates of the caribbean, you physically navigate the space to reaveal a story. from standing in line, etc
		- premise of the film is based on the ride

- spatial stories
	- navigating the space is integral to the story

- `Literature` versus literature
	- who knows, who dictates them? why? whatever.

- what is a game (medium, genre, how they influence narrative)
	- not all games tell stories
	- some have narrative aspirations
	- games with narratives are not better games
	- experience of games cannot be reduced to story
	- games tell stories differently than other mediums

- spatiality
	- games sculpt spaces. not just tell narratives
	- narrative architect: less storytellers, more space architects

4 types of narratives
	- evoked narrative (enhave sense of immersion or communicate fresh perspective)
	- enacted narrative (features of environment slow or speed up plot trajectory centered around characters movement)
	- embedded: you discover narrative
	- emergent: story constructing activity of players
